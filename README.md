# search-engine
This is a group porject with Jiawei Gu on writing a search engine from scratch (without popular libs like Lucene).
The html source files are provided after we did the crawling on ics.uci.edu.
The programming language is python and the databse is mongodb.
We implemented forward indexing, inverted indexing, tf-idf scoring and pagerank algorithm. Also, we developed a simple web interface for searching based on the flask framework of python.
