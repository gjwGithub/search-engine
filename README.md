# search-engine
This is a group porject with Jiawei Gu on writing a search engine from scratch (without popular libs like Lucene).

Demo website: <a ref = "http://54.183.198.179:5555">Search Engine for ics.uci.edu</a>

The html source files are provided after we did the crawling on ics.uci.edu.

The programming language is python and the databse is mongodb.

We implemented forward indexing, inverted indexing, tf-idf scoring, cosine similartity, pagerank algorithm and RankSVM to learn the weights of cosine similarity and pagerank. Also, we developed a simple web interface for searching based on the flask framework of python.
